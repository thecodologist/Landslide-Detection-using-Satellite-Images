#### The Landslide Prediction Project uses machine learning to assess geohazard risks. It collects geological, topographical, and environmental data and selects important features to accurately identify landslide-prone areas. Using the TensorFlow U-Net model, it develops a predictive model with historical data, ensuring reliability. Stakeholders can access and interpret the model outputs through a user-friendly interface. The project advances landslide prediction, aiding proactive risk management in geohazard-prone regions.
